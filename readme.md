# Cookie Clicker

## About

It is an "incrementer" game, as proclaimed by Orteil. The point of the game is to bake cookies by clicking on a giant cookie until you have enough cookies to buy upgrades. The seemingly endless gameplay makes it a game that can last an indefinite amount of time, or at least until your device can no longer run it.

## Objective

We are gonna automate the job of baking the cookies using bot instead of tapping the cookies. It will simultaneously click it and bake the cookies.

## Setup

1. **Install Python:**
   - Make sure you have Python installed on your system. If not, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   - To work with the packages, you have to install them. You can do this by using the command prompt or terminal.
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Script:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory.
   - Execute the Python script using the following command:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```
     If you're using Python 3, use `python3` instead:
     ```bash
     python3 main.py
     ```
